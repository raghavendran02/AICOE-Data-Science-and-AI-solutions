# Background of the customer problem
We purchase vegetables online and some of them might not be of good quality. 
Customers usually raise a compaint, chat with the customer care(usually a bot) and share the photos of the rotten vegetables
Customer complaints need to be reviewed and appropriate action has to be taken either
to replace the bad quality vegetable or provide a refund, if in case the vegetable if of a bad quality
Now to confirm the vegetables are rotten or not, a human need to validate the pic and confirm
# Solution
Alternatively, a CNN based image classifier was integrated with the bot.
Once the photo of the vegetable was uploaded the CNN based image classifier classifies the vegetable as rotten or not
This helped the end user get a faster response and inurn increasing their overall experience.
